## Trying to Automate This

I am going to point R at the 
```{r gathering PDF}
html <- read_html('https://investors.target.com/events-and-presentations/archived') #pointing to the website
```

Let's take a peak at the html and see if you can find the links to the transcripts of the earnings calls.

```{r}
links <- html %>%
  html_nodes("a") %>%
  html_attr("href") 

links <- links[str_detect(links,pattern = 'investors')][14:52] #found the ones with investor in the name and grabed the ones that look like pdfs
```
